## Dataset instructions:

**Links:**
1. ISIC 2018 challange: <https://challenge2018.isic-archive.com>
2. Task 1 data: <https://challenge.kitware.com/#phase/5abcb19a56357d0139260e53>
3. Task 2 data: <https://challenge.kitware.com/#phase/5abcbb6256357d0139260e5f>

**Dataset download instructions:**

* The full set of data is around 12 GB. Some registration needed to download the dataset so you have to follow the instructions below. 

* After you did the folowing steps you will get three directory in your download folder:

  * .../ISIC2018_Task1-2_Training_Input

  * .../ISIC2018_Task1_Training_GroundTruth

  * .../ISIC2018_Task2_Training_GroundTruth_v3

Our work is focused **only** on Task 1, so you can discard *ISIC2018_Task2_Training_GroundTruth_v3* dataset if you want.

You have to put these three directory to a new one which name has to be .../ISIC2018. Thus you should get the following paths:

  * .../ISIC2018/ISIC2018_Task1-2_Training_Input
  * .../ISIC2018/ISIC2018_Task1_Training_GroundTruth
  * .../ISIC2018/ISIC2018_Task2_Training_GroundTruth_v3

The used links are available above. For the Task 1 and Task 2 the original images are the same. The original images are in the training dataset. The ground truth for the Task 1 and Task 2 is different so it has to be downloaded separately. The ground truth images are in the ground truth dataset. The dataset downloading instructions are the following:

  * Use the [Task 1 data link](https://challenge.kitware.com/#phase/5abcb19a56357d0139260e53). You will see the folowing. You will have to use the "Participate in this phase" link and you will have to do a quick registration with your google account.

  </p>

  * After the previous step you will see the following page. Use the two downloading links.

  </p>

  * In the next step use the [Task 2 data link](https://challenge.kitware.com/#phase/5abcbb6256357d0139260e5f). You will see a very simliar page like in the Task 1 case. Use again the "Participate in this phase" link.

  </p>

  * Finally you will see this page. Now you have to download only the ground truth data because the training dataset (original images) is the same.
